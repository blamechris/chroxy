/**
 * Shared client connect-flow orchestration (#5556 sub-item 4, epic #5556).
 *
 * The app (`packages/app/src/store/connection.ts`) and the dashboard
 * (`packages/dashboard/src/store/connection.ts`) hand-maintained two parallel
 * `connect()` orchestrations: same constants, same recursion, same decision
 * tree — only the *effects* (which store the phase is written to, the give-up
 * UX, the pairing/device-id wiring) legitimately differ. That left ~120
 * lockstep lines that had to be edited in two places forever (the #5594 backoff
 * ladder, #5555 restart detection, the #3624 reconnect dedup were each ported by
 * hand and drifted in their guard placement).
 *
 * This module owns the ALGORITHM — the attempt counting, the RETRY_DELAYS delay
 * ladder, the probe → restart → connect decision tree, and the per-socket
 * reconnect-schedule dedup. Each client supplies the *effects* as callbacks
 * (probe the host, open the socket, write the phase, schedule a timer, surface a
 * give-up). The clients keep their store writes + platform glue in those
 * callbacks; the orchestration stops being copy-pasted.
 *
 * Mirrors the `createDeltaFlusher` template (#5588): pure, dependency-free,
 * injectable scheduler so store-core's own tests run on a deterministic fake and
 * the client call sites work with jest/vitest fake timers (which patch the
 * globals) out of the box.
 *
 * ## Two cooperating pieces
 *
 * 1. `runConnectAttempt` — the pre-WebSocket orchestration for ONE connect
 *    attempt: probe the host, branch on the result (ok / restarting / failed),
 *    and either open the socket, schedule the next retry, or give up. Recurses
 *    through the client's `connect()` for retries (the client owns the recursion
 *    entry point so each retry re-runs its full store setup).
 *
 * 2. `createReconnectScheduler` — the per-socket close/error reconnect
 *    scheduler: a single-arm dedup flag (#3624) wrapping the shared RETRY_DELAYS
 *    backoff ladder (#5594). The client invokes it from `onclose`/`onerror`
 *    after its own platform guards.
 *
 * ## #5597 / #5537 seam — `resolveEndpoint(attempt)`
 *
 * Endpoint selection is a PER-ATTEMPT callback, not a closure-captured constant.
 * Each client's `resolveEndpoint(attempt)` re-reads the CURRENT endpoint from
 * its authoritative store every attempt (#5597): the app re-derives the tunnel
 * URL from the saved connection (so a rotated `tunnel_url_changed` push / a URL
 * persisted from a prior session is picked up on the next retry); the dashboard
 * re-reads the active registry entry's `wsUrl` + token. The app additionally
 * threads `attempt` into {@link selectReconnectEndpoint} for the #5537 LAN→tunnel
 * fast fallback (a dead `ws://` LAN host fails over to the tunnel after
 * {@link LAN_FALLBACK_THRESHOLD} attempts instead of burning the whole budget).
